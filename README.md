### **Summary**

Recycling polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) from packaging materials consumes much energy with big economic and environmental costs. To meet this demand, a direct recycling of rPET into woven fabrics was proposed in this study to take advantage of the mechanical performance of materials. The mechanical properties of rPET were tested along its orthogonal directions. The testing data was used to calibrate an elasto-plastic model to capture the constitutive behaviour of materials. The experimental results showed a strong anisotropy of rPET materials and distinct mechanical behaviour of elasticity and ductility. A virtual weaving process of fabrics from rPET fibres was presented by finite element analysis (FEA) to replicate the manufacturing process. The process simulation revealed the critical role of material ductility of rPET fibres for warp yarns. Process parameters on motion and tension of fibres were suggested for different yarn configura-tions to achieve the weaving process. The operational sensitivity study addressed the influence of friction between fibres on the tension force of the warp yarns. 

A dynamic simulation by using FEA (OpenRadioss, Altair) is shown below:
